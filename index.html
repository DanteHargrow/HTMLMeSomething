            <p class="paragraph">
                A little about myself! I got into coding my senior year of highschool and thought it was so fun! Going into college I wasn't the best with math so I decided to major
                in Information Technology instead of Computer Science. Now IT and CS are different but similar and at UMKC I took mostly CS classes so luckily I was still able to enjoy
                coding and learning different things. I ended up having an internship at a small local business that did web development, which I enjoyed tremendously!
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Fast forward to now, I didn't end up getting a job doing web development or even software engineering, I ended up working for Cerner being a technical solution analyst. It was a good start to get
                my foot in the door since I had limited coding projects and I do look at written code a lot and write tons of queries, so I'm not complaining! However I slowly started to lose my skills as I wasn't 
                utilizing them or practicing outside of work! Which brought me to LaunchCode, I wanted to relearn from a class perspective instead of just reading a book. Then potentially put a project together 
                and find a software engineering job!
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="padding-bottom: 70px;">
                Thus this far I haven't been dissappointed, definitely have learned quite a lot! Even learned somethings I think my college courses could've hit on! I've been enjoying JS to the fullest, but I am
                quite excited to start the second unit and relearn C#, as that was the first language I learned way back in 2014-2015 during my senior year of highschool!
